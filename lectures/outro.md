Now that we have had an opportunity to work through the Remix package by building
our app, let's consider some pros and cons.

Pros:

- file based routing makes sense, right?
- Keeping your server side actions/loaders in the same file as the UI page helps
  to reduce context switching and should make it easier to develop.
- You learn remix, you learn the web.

Cons:

- This is a new (albeit remixed) model of web development. Surely there will be
  some mental conflict as you work to create new patterns and abandon old patterns.
- Because it is new, a community still needs to be built up that creates blog posts,
  forums, and stack overflow answers to our questions. Right now, the docs are about
  it. (But they are really good docs!)
- Also, because it is new, there still isn't really an "idiomatic remix" as new
  concepts are always filled with a rush of ideas on the best way to do things. It
  may be a few years before foot guns are flushed out.
