We will start with the `/presentation` route. To do that, create a file at
`app/routes/presentation/index.tsx`.

In that file, you need to `export default` a react component.

- Simple: Make a "Hello World" component
- Advanced: Make a table with a header for now. We will populate with data later.

Don't worry about any styling, we will cover that next.
