1. Create the `/logout` resource route.
2. Add a `logout` button to the `<Header>` component in `app/root.tsx`.

Hints:

- Why do you want to use a form instead of a link for the `logout` button?
- What should the `action` prop on the form be?

Extra credit:
Suppose that you want to download a csv of the presentations for your coworkers.
Implement the functionality to do that.
